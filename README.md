# RentAhotelRoom-ASP.NET

First commit.
I used the scaffolding from Visual Studio as a base for the project.

Second commit.
I created a page called Hotels that acts like a list for all hotels and the amount of rooms 
they contain. The page has been added to the navigation bar as well.

Third commit.
I created a Search page, where you can check if a specific hotel is a part of the website.

Fourth commit.
I removed HotelTotalRooms from the Hotels table, so that it doesn't duplicate with the Details function.
Added simple authentication that forces the user to log into an account if they want to add/edit/delete something.
